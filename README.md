# wagchallengeby Pablo GomezThis is my approach for the challenge given to me. I tried to keep it as scalable as possible that is why I have created and API and services to curry an specific task and trying to always keep the MVC and responsiveness in my mind.I have also used helpers for hashing values, print on the logcat in a proper way and format URLs in a ordered and understandable way.I have only used two third-party libraries GSON for serializing data and deserializing data and okhttp from Square Inc. for creating HTTP RESTful request to the stackoverflow API, it is right now one of the best HTTP libraries right now. I could have used Picasso or Glider on top of okhttp for dealing with downloadingand displaying the avatar and they even have caching but I decided to keep the app light do not add more libraries than need it so I wrote my own cache with in memory cache as an LRU cache and simple disk cache.**Thanks for reading!**-Pablo Gomez
